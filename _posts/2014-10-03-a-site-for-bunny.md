# A photo gallery of mine

In the days without Bunny, I decided to take photo each night
embodying what I was doing that evening. With the photos I've
taken, I needed to figure out a way to present them to my Bunny :P

Here comes this Famo.us web page. I wanted to make a simple gallery
with little animations. There should be picture wall and then
those pictures can flip around and show the letters on their back.

I started with GridLayout of a set of ImageSurfaces, but then I
encountered number of difficulties to make them transit as I planned.
Given this situation, I went back to the demos shipped with starter kit of Famo.us.
After some digging, I caught the idea of how to put views together and
run animations for each view accordingly.

I am going to tear down everything I've got since it is not really
working and then rewrite the whole page.

Now the page is done, views worked pretty well :D Time to say good night.

In the next morning, I decided to add more transitions rather than make the grid
gallery disappear instantly. Apart from that, I added a song to the page as well.
So upon opening, pictures will be loading the song will be playing, after several
clicks on the page, anywhere, a small card will show eventually.
